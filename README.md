# UNI Admission Analysis

The purpose is to perform an exploratory data analysis on a dataset based on the number of applicants at UNI during the period 21-1 and 24-1

Results:
1. The 2022-2 cycle shows an increase in vacancies and a reduction in the minimum entrance grade, which resulted in:
- A higher percentage and number of new entrants.
- Lower average grades for new entrants.
2. In the hypothetical exercise, raising the minimum grade to 10 for 2022-2 would have reduced the number of entrants by 239 (≈−5.86 pp), affecting the composition and averages.
